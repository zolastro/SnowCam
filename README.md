Let it snow with p5.js using your own webcam! Make screenshots of you and your friends with this simple app to get get into the Spirit of the Season!

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
You must have installed python. You can see how to do this in this [link](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).
### Running SnowCam
In order to run SnowCam, you must first clone this repository. Then, you should open your terminal and go into the cloned repository. Afterwards, you may run the following command:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer  
```
This will run a local HTTP server at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). You just have to open that url in your default browser and that's all.
## Contributing
This is a small project without any propper goal. However, if you want to colaborate and develop it further, go ahead!
